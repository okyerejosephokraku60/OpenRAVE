Here are a few Termux commands to activate OpenRAVE:

1. Install Termux on your Android device from the Google Play Store.
2. Open Termux and type the following command to update the package lists:

```
$ pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

3. Type the following command to install Python3 and git:

```
$ pkg install python git
```

4. Install OpenRAVE by running the installation script in your Termux terminal:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rdiankov/openrave-installation.git
```
```
$ cd openrave-installation
```
```
$ ./install.sh -py 3
```

This will install OpenRAVE and its dependencies needed to run it.

5. To run OpenRAVE in Termux, type the following command:

```
$ openrave.py
```

This will open a Python shell with OpenRAVE loaded. You can start writing code to simulate and plan robot motions in this shell.

Note that while OpenRAVE can be installed and run on a mobile device like an Android phone, it may be limited by performance and screen size. It is recommended to use a desktop computer or laptop running a Linux operating system for optimal performance.
